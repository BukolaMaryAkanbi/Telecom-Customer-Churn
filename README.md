# Telecom-Customer-Churn
# PowerBi visualization
The dataset I'm working with includes churn data for a fictional Telecommunications company. It consists of information about 7,043 customers in California, including details about their demographics, location, services, and current status.

In this project, I conducted an analysis to assist the company in enhancing customer retention. By identifying high-value customers and potential churn risks, I created a concise, single-page report to provide actionable insights.
